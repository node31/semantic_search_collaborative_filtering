The Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs), and the related National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER) are a group of premier science education and research institutes in India. The institutes were created by the Government of India, through the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), under The National Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Bill, 2010 (an amendment of the National Institutes of Technology Act, 2007), which was passed by the Rajya Sabha on 30 April 2012.[1] Five IISERs have been established across the country, namely IISER Kolkata in West Bengal, IISER Pune in Maharashtra, IISER Mohali in Punjab, IISER Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh and IISER Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala.[2] The financial outlay for each IISER is around INR5 billion (US$84 million) for the first five years. NISER is being set up in Bhubaneswar for a slightly higher outlay of INR8 billion (US$130 million).[3]

National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar began functioning shortly after the foundation stone was laid down on 28 August 2006 by the prime minister. Unlike its sister institutions, the IISERs, NISER is being administered by the Department of Atomic Energy. A somewhat larger campus of 300 acres (1.2 km2) is planned.

Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata is functioning from the temporary campus at Mohanpur, a temporary arrangement within the campus of Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya. Some labs have already been shifted to its permanent campus, over 250 acres (1.0 km2) of land at Haringhata, Kalyani near Kolkata.[4]

Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune has started functioning from the National Chemical Laboratory Pune campus. Its permanent campus is under construction on 100 acres (0.40 km2) of land at Pashan, Pune.

Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali has started functioning from the Mahatma Gandhi State Institute of Public Administration complex in Sector 26 Chandigarh. The foundation stone for its permanent campus was laid in September 2006 by the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh. The teaching program has commenced from August 2007.Now Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali is fully functioning on its permanent campus at Sector 81, Mohali.

Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal started functioning from the ITI Gas Rahat Building Govindpura Bhopal. The Institute shifted to its main campus in Bhauri in August 2012.[5]

Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram has started functioning from the College of Engineering, Trivandrum. Land for the permanent campus has been identified at Vithura, within 30 km from the city, near Ponmudi. The Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology will be within few kilometres.
